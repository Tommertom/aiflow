Dalton and Michael discuss the impact of the Zero Interest Rate Phenomenon (ZERP) on the startup world. ZERP, a period marked by extremely low or even negative interest rates, enabled banks to obtain cheap capital, which they funneled into various alternative investments, including venture capital (VC). This influx of money led to inflated valuations and excessive investments in startups, often without sufficient scrutiny or accountability. 

They highlight that many new investors, unfamiliar with startup economics, treated startup investments like traditional stock investments, leading to reckless funding rounds based on unsustainable revenue-to-valuation multiples. The environment fostered a culture of overconfidence, with founders expecting easy access to large sums of money, leading to often wasteful spending. 

As interest rates eventually rose, the easy money disappeared, leaving many startups unprepared and unsustainable. They suggest that while some founders managed their funds wisely, many others built their businesses on the unstable foundation of easy capital, resulting in dire consequences once the market corrected. 

The discussion emphasizes the importance of balancing optimism with realism in entrepreneurship, advising that successful businesses remain resilient and adaptable across different economic climates.
